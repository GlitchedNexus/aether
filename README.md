# Aether

## Overview

Aether is an advanced electromagnetic analysis tool for identifying and characterizing radar signature contributions from 3D models. It analyzes geometric features—facets, edges, and tips—to determine their relative contributions to radar cross-section (RCS), enabling informed decisions in signature reduction, sensor placement, and machine learning applications, all without requiring expertise in electromagnetic physics.
