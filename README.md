# Aether

## 🚀 Project Overview

Aether is a tool for identifying which parts of a 3D drone model contribute most to its radar signature under a given radar illumination geometry. By highlighting dominant “scattering centers” (facets, edges, tips), Aether helps engineers, researchers, and data scientists make informed decisions about signature reduction, sensor placement, and training data generation—without diving into low‑level physics code.

## 📚 Background & Relevance

- **Radar Cross Section (RCS):** A measure of how detectable an object is by radar. Complex drone geometries create multiple scattering centers, complicating both stealth design and detection planning.
- **Drone Applications:** From military stealth adaptations to commercial counter‑UAS sensors, understanding which airframe features dominate returns can drive targeted design changes.
- **ML Training:** Annotated scattering‑center data boosts the fidelity of radar‑based machine‑learning models, improving automated threat detection and classification.

## 🎯 User Stories

1. **As a Signature‑Reduction Engineer**,
   I want to see a ranked list of surface patches and edges that produce the strongest radar returns,
   so that I can selectively apply radar‑absorbent materials or geometric tweaks only where needed.
2. **As a Counter‑UAS Sensor Designer**,
   I want to predict detection ranges for common radar bands against a given drone mesh,
   so that I can size and position my transceivers appropriately.
3. **As an RCS‑ML Researcher**,
   I want exportable labels (coordinates + intensity scores) of scattering centers,
   so that I can train and validate statistical or deep‑learning models.
4. **As a Systems Integrator**,
   I want a lightweight command‑line interface that processes a mesh and outputs a heatmap overlay plus a data table,
   so that I can plug Aether into larger simulation or CI/CD pipelines.
5. **As an Educator**,
   I want accessible visualization of how geometry affects radar returns,
   so that I can demonstrate high‑frequency EM concepts in class or workshops.

## 📦 MVP Scope

- **Input:** Import a cleaned 3D mesh file (STL/OBJ/PLY).
- **Configuration:** Specify one transmit and one receive position plus a radar frequency band.
- **Extraction:** Identify and rank the top N candidate scatterers (facets, edges, tips).
- **Output:**

  - A colored heatmap overlay on the mesh (visual .PLY or similar).
  - A CSV of (x, y, z, score) for the top N scatterers.

- **Basic UI:** Simple CLI with flags for input path, frequency, geometry, and output folder.
- **Documentation:** Quick‑start guide and illustrative examples with a reference drone model.

## 🧪 Types of Tests

1. **Unit Tests**

   - Geometry loader handles inverted normals, duplicate vertices, and missing faces.
   - Scoring algorithms produce expected relative rankings on simple primitives (e.g., flat plate, sphere).
   - Configuration parser validates frequency, positions, and thresholds.

2. **Integration Tests**

   - End‑to‑end runs on a small reference mesh; output files exist and meet schema.
   - CLI invocation returns zero exit code and provides meaningful error messages on bad inputs.

3. **Accuracy & Validation Tests**

   - Compare extracted scatterers and scores against analytical benchmarks (e.g., analytical RCS of a flat plate, sphere).
   - Cross‑validate against a trusted numerical solver for at least one simple geometry.

4. **Performance Tests**

   - Measure processing time and memory on meshes of increasing complexity (10K to 1M triangles).
   - Ensure heatmap export time scales near‑linearly with triangle count.

5. **Regression Tests**

   - Archive a suite of small meshes and expected CSVs; detect unintended changes in ranking or output format.

6. **User Acceptance Tests**

   - Validate that a new user can follow the quick‑start guide to generate a heatmap on a provided sample model.
   - Gather feedback on command syntax and documentation clarity.
